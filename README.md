# Starter Web Repo

This repository is for showing how Git and GitHub work

## Purpose

Sample website with plenty of files for demos

## Opps
It appears that during the training I was supposed to set up a README.md file, but this already existed. So I am changing it to see the difference from what is already staged (or committed???) using difftool.
